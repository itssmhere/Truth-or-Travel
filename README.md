# Truth-or-Travel
 Truth or Travel is a fun and engaging way of encouraging members to explore the various trails and cultural cuisines of their city/province, or even country! Most people may claim to be “lazy” to try something new but this program provides an incentive for people to do so. We recognize that people are motivated by competition, and so, this game is designed to be played with friends. As a group, each member will first need to answer 4 questions about their preferences in order to ensure that the game is tailored to their liking. After this, Truth or Travel provides a total of 4 random dares: 2 about exploring the trails and 2 about exploring food ( ex. “Take a picture of you eating Bruschetta at Tonino's Pizzeria & Panini”), which are selected based on the players personal preferences provided during the quiz. The person who finishes all 4 dares first wins the game.
